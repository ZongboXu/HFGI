Modelling high-frequency (>0.5 Hz) guided infrasound in an atmosphere, where the guided infrasound here is the infrasound being trapped near the ground surface during the infraound propagation. We have applied this modelling algorithm to the Martian and Earth's atmospsheric models. More details about the application and the algorithm are in our paper.
