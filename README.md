Modelling high-frequency (>0.5 Hz) guided infrasound propagation in the atmosphere and the corresponding seismic recording. This guided infrasound refers to sound waves trapped near the ground surface during propagation. These waves also deform the ground surface, thus being recorded by seismometers. This deformation can be computed using compliance. We have applied our modelling algorithm to field exampls on both Mars and Earth to compare the synthetics to the seismic recordings. More details about this modelling and the application details can be found in our papers.
